# Iris Dataset Cleaning with R
This repository contains an R script that processes and analyzes the Iris dataset. The script includes steps for data inspection, handling missing values, and transforming data types. It also involves cleaning the dataset by renaming columns, removing duplicates, and creating a new feature for the petal length-to-width ratio. Additionally, the script generates various visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and density plots, to explore the relationships between different features of the dataset. The cleaned dataset is saved as a CSV file for further analysis.
